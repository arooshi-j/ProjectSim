# ProjectSim

This project uses OpenGL and C++ to create an interactive simulation of balls under the inluence of gravity.
A ball with a random velocity is generated at the desired point by a mouse click and it bounces following the laws of physics till it comes to rest.

Future changes : Initial velocity will be User controlled.
                 Path followed by the ball will be visible.
                 Motion of upto 5 balls could be compared.
