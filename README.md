# ProjectSim

This project uses OpenGL and C++ to create an interactive simulation of balls under the inluence of gravity.
A ball with a random velocity is generated at the desired point by a mouse click and it bounces following the laws of physics till it comes to rest.

Future changes : User controlled initial velocity will be added and a line for the path followed by the ball. A limit to compare paths of upto 5 balls at once.
